Introduction
------------
This is a repository for documenting the FreeEMS Puma board.

The documentation is written in markdown syntax and can be converted to many formats, including HTML and PDF.

Building the documentation
--------------------------
The included build script is a Ruby script, which depends on BlueCloth. To install this dependency, you'll need to install Ruby, RubyGems and run:
 sudo gem install bluecloth

To build the documentation, run this:
 ruby build.rb
..or:
 ./build.rb

Doing that will build a HTML page into the "html" subdirectory (it's created automatically).

Contributing to the documentation
---------------------------------
* Fork this project on github.
* Edit contents of "spin1" directory or create another directory with similar structure.
* Verify the output of build.rb is valid. Edit the .md files until it is!
* Commit and push your changes
  * Don't commit the "html" directory or edit its contents, it's intended for the build results.
  * Notify the original author with a pull request
