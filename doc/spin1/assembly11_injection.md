## Step 16 : Injection circuits

Using solder paste, place beads on all of the following component pads R203, C118.

#### Injection 1
/-- 337x260 img/reflow/IMG_0355.JPG "" Install injection circuits. 

Please note image shown is for injector 8 circuit, it is recommended you start at injector 1.

- **R203** *(1K&ohm;)* located between/below U23 ``&`` U24.
- **R257** *(Not used no connection)*
- **D110** *(Not used no connection)*
- **D89**  *(Not used no connection)*
- **C118** *(**MOD** this modification requires replacing the capacitor with a Green Injection LED)*
