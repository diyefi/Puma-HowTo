## Step 17 : Injection circuits ##

Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads R203, R257, D110, C118.

#### Injection 1 ####
/-- 337x260 img/reflow/IMG_0355.JPG "" Install injection circuits. 

- **R203** *(1K&ohm;)* located between/below U22 ``&`` U23.
- **R257** *(2.4K&ohm;)*
- **D110** *(LED Green)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the LEFT of the PCB. 
- **D89**  *(Not used no connection YET)*
- **C118** *(**MOD** R100)* Change to R=100K and mod to ground on pin 3 of u26 when not using "Peak and Hold" Circuit --> May not be needed

See [through hole](#assembly13_after_reflow) assembly injection section for the remainder of the injection modification.

- LED is direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the Right of the PCB. This is shown by the green tip.
