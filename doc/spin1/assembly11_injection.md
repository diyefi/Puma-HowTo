## Injection circuits ##
**Step X :**

Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads R203, R257, D110, C118.

#### Injection 1 ####
/-- 128x128 img/placeholder_image.png "" Install injection circuits. 

- **R203** *(1K&ohm;)* located between/below U22 ``&`` U23.
- **R257** *(2.4K&ohm;)*
- **D110** *(LED Green)* direction dependant, orientate the **K** lead to the LEFT of the PCB. 
- **D89**  *(Not used no connection YET)*
- **C118** *(**MOD** R100)* Change to R=100K and mod to ground on pin 3 of u26 when not using "Peak and Hold" Circuit --> May not be needed
