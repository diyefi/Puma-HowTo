## Step 16 : Injection circuits

Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads R203, C118.

#### Injection 1
/-- 337x260 img/reflow/IMG_0355.JPG "" Install injection circuits. 

- **R203** *(1K&ohm;)* located between/below U22 ``&`` U23.
- **R257** *(Not used no connection)*
- **D110** *(Not used no connection)*
- **D89**  *(Not used no connection)*
- **C118** *(**MOD** Green Injection LED)*

/-- 337x260 img/reflow/IMG_0362.JPG "" Installed injection 1 LED in new location.
 
- LED is direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the Right of the PCB. This is shown by the green tip.
