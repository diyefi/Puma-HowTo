#### RPM circuits ####
**Step X :**
Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads U26, R214,C126, C125, R212, R213, R39, R40.

- **RPM - VR Input 1**
	- **U29**  *(MAX9924)* Due to the very fine foot print care will need to be taken with laying solder paste that **NO** bridges are formed.
	- **R214** *(10K&ohm;)*	
	- **C126** *(0.1µF)*
	- **C125** *(1nF)*
	- **R212** *(10K&ohm; 1/4watt)*
	- **R213** *(10K&ohm; 1/4watt)*
	- **R39**  *(1K&ohm;)*	
	- **R40**  *(**MOD** 0805 jumper)* use a 0805 package 0&ohm; jumper, this modification is made to maintain optimal input resistance to MCU.
	- **D24**  *(Zener not used)* negatively impacts on the signal fidelity.
