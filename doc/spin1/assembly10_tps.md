#### TPS circuit ####
**Step X :**
Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads R161, C87, D62, D63, R165.

/-- 128x128 img/placeholder_image.png "" Install TPS circuits. 

- **R161** *(470R)*
- **C87**  *(0.1uF)* can be mounted in either direction (Non polarised).
- **D62**  *(Schottky)* direction dependant, orentate the **K** lead to the BOTTOM of the PCB. This is hard to find on the PCB as the text is obscured by another component outline. located bottom left of U18.
- **D63**  *(Schottky)* direction dependant, orentate the **K** lead to the TOP of the PCB.This is hard to find on the PCB as the text is obscured by another component outline. located bottom left of U18.
- **R165** *(**MOD** 0805 jumper)* use a 0805 package 0&ohm; jumper, this modifation is made to maintain optimal input resistance to MCU.
