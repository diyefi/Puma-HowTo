#### Step 16 : TPS circuit ####

Using solder paste place beads on all of the following component pads R161, C87, D62, D63, R165.

- **R161** *(470R)*
- **C87**  *(0.1ÂµF)* 
- **D62**  *(Schottky)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the BOTTOM of the PCB. This is hard to find on the PCB as the text is obscured by another component outline. located bottom left of U18.
- **D63**  *(Schottky)* direction dependant, orient the **K** lead to the TOP of the PCB.This is hard to find on the PCB as the text is obscured by another component outline. located bottom left of U18.
- **R165** *(**MOD** 0805 jumper)* use a 0805 package 0&ohm; jumper, this modification is made to maintain optimal input resistance to MCU.
