# Assembly Tools
#### What you will need to assemble your SPIN1 PCB ####

There is two methods for assembly one is with a soldering iron, the other requires a reflow oven. A Reflow Oven can be easily made from cheap bench top mini grills. **NEVER EVER** use a oven that is used for cooking food! toxic fumes are given off during the reflow process. 

#### Soldering iron method 1 #####

The process of assembly with a soldering iron is rated 8/10 :

- **Method 1 tools requirements** :
	- Soldering iron
	- Side cutters
	- Stanley knife / Razor blade
	- Bench mounted magnifying glass or 4x optical power reading glasses work well from the $2 shop
	- Long nose pliers
	- Tweezers (pointy type)
	- Fine gauge solder
	- Solder wick
	- Super glue
	- Anti-static surface
	- Multimeter or Oscilloscope, or any other appropriate voltage and current testing device.

#### Reflow oven method 2 ####

The reflow assembly process is rated 6/10 for difficulty to assembly :

- **Method 2 tools requirements** :
	- Soldering iron for through hole component soldering
	- Reflow oven
	- Side cutters
	- Stanley knife / Razor blade
	- Bench mounted magnifying glass or 4x optical power reading glasses work well from the $2 shop
	- Long nose pliers
	- Tweezers (pointy type)
	- Syringe of solder paste
	- Solder wick
	- Super glue
	- Anti-static surface 
	- Multimeter or Oscilloscope, or any other appropriate voltage and current testing device.
