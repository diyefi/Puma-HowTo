#### What you will need to assemble your PCB ####

There is two methods for assembly one is with a soldering iron, the other requires a reflow oven. A Reflow Oven can be easly made from cheap bench top mini grils. **NEVER EVER** use a oven that is used for cooking food! toxic fumes are given off during the reflow process. 

#### Soldering iron method 1 #####

The process of assembly with a soldering iron is rated 8/10 :

- **Method 1 tools requirements** :
	- Soldering iron
	- Side cutters
	- Stanley knife / Rasor blade
	- Bench mounted magnifing glass or 4x optical power reading glasses work well from the $2 shop
	- Long nose pliers
	- Tweesers (pointy type)
	- Fine gauge solder
	- Solder wick
	- Anti-static surface

#### Reflow oven method 2 ####

The reflow assembly process is rated 6/10 for difficualty to assembly :

- **Method 2 tools requirements** :
	- Soldering iron for through hole compenent soldering
	- Reflow oven
	- Side cutters
	- Stanley knife / Rasor blade
	- Bench mounted magnifing glass or 4x optical power reading glasses work well from the $2 shop
	- Long nose pliers
