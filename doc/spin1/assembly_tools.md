# Assembly Tools
#### What you will need to assemble your SPIN 1 PCB

There are two methods for assembly, one is with a soldering iron, the other requires a reflow oven. A reflow oven can be easily made from cheap bench top mini grills. **NEVER EVER** use a oven that is used for cooking food! toxic fumes are given off during the reflow process. 


- **Common tool requirements** :

	- Temperature controlled soldering iron (fine tip) for PCB work
	- An ordinary 35 Watt soldering iron for soldering wires
	- Side cutters
	- Stanley knife / razor blade
	- Long nose pliers
	- Drill bits
		- 1.5 mm
		- 3 mm
		- 5 mm
	- Sharp center punch (a 3" nail with a sharpened tip would be sufficient)	
	- Tweezers (pointy type)	
	- Fine gauge solder 0.5mm for surface mount applications
	- Solder wick
	- Super glue
	- Anti-static work surface (other substitutes are aluminium foil, anti static component bags)
	- Multimeter and/or oscilloscope, or any other appropriate voltage and current testing device.
	- Bench power supply or 12V battery.
	

#### Reflow oven, method 1

The reflow assembly process is rated 6/10 for difficulty of assembly :

- **Method 1 tool requirements** :
	- Reflow oven
	- Optical magnifier (4x optical power reading glasses from the $2 shop work well)
	- Syringe of solder paste
	- Syringe of heat activated component glue
	- Cotton buds

#### Soldering iron, method 2

The process of assembly with a soldering iron is rated 8/10 :

- **Method 2 tool requirements** :

	- Bench mounted magnifying glass or 4x optical power reading glasses.
