## Sourcing the components

You might already have some of the components, omit those.


#### If you prefer Mouser or Element14:
The BOM is aimed at getting most of the components from one supplier to minimise freighting costs, with global distribution.
This BOM has all the component part numbers and links for [Element14] as an alternative some [Mouser] options have also been included.

Just copy and past the supplier part numbers for required sub-circuit to the relevant suppliers shopping cart.

#### If you prefer Newark or Digi-Key:
Unfortunately a Newark/Digi-Key BOM equivalent has not yet been developed for Puma Spin1 when done it will be linked here, if you develop one that works let us know.
