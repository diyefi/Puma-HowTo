## Sourcing the components

You might already have some of the components, omit those.

### If you prefer Newark, Mouser or Farnell:
The second sheet (MFG BOM) of the spreadsheet has a table of components formatted for these distributors.

### If you prefer Digikey:
The third sheet (DIGIKEY BOM) of the spreadsheet has a table of components formatted in the Digikey format.

Next, just export the sheet of your choice into a Comma-Separated-Values (.csv) formated file and submit the CSV file into the web store of your favourite parts supplier.
