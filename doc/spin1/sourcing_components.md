## Sourcing the components

You might already have some of the components, omit those.


#### If you prefer Newark, Mouser or Element14:
The BOM is aimed at getting most the components from one supplier to minimise freighting costs, with global distribuition.
This BOM has all the component part numbers and links for [Element14] as an alternitive some [Mouser] options have also been included.

Just copy and past the supplier part numbers for required sub-circuit to the relevant suppliers shopping cart.

#### If you prefer Digikey:
Unfortunatly a Digikey BOM equilivent has not yet been developed for Puma Spin1 when done it will be linked here, if you develop one that works let us know.
