# Bill of Materials

The BOM is broken down into sub-circuits so you, as the end user, can pick and choose which circuits are best suited to your project. For each sub-circuit there is a matching assembly section.
The primary components are compulsory to achieve a functional 'FreeEMS brain'. All other sections are optional, however a combination of these will be necessary for an engine to run.

Open the BOM. The right hand side of each blue sub-circuit title is the page number, which corresponds to the [schematic and circuitry] that those components relate to.

### Overview with Important notes

- A large number of parts will be unpopulated, replaced with a zero ohm jumper, or solder bridge.
- The EGT circuit won't work (it has a 500&deg;C limit) without changing it's supply to 12 Volt and adding a Voltage divider. No instructions will be proved within this howto.
- The stepper driver circuit is defunked, don't go there.
- The shut-down circuit won't work, the parts for it are not in the BOM and there will just be unpopulated pads for it on the PCB.
- The XOR based ignitor drive is too weak and should be further buffered with something that can put out a 12V signal at around 100mA.
- The Injection driver circuits are incorrectly laid out, and require a modification which is covered in this howto to function the bom only includes parts for High-Z injectors.
- The USB circuit requires an additional component in the way of a TO92 packaged PNP transistor *UNLESS* a modified SM is used (currently not available untill 30 Feburary 2012)
- The USB connector is wrong (It's female A, which is reserved for host devices) however it is functional. Cables are hard to come by, the options are:
	- Hack a mini-USB or type B female connector instead and use an appropriate cable.
	- Build a A-A cable from two common USB cables.
	- buy male A-A cable.

#### Legend of acronyms ####
Some or all of these acronyms are used in the original schematic documentation.

- **INJ-H**: *(**Inj**ector **H**igh impedance)*
  	- If you have high impedance injectors (``>6``&ohm;), these can be driven directly from Puma with the correct mods.
  	
- **INJ-L**: *(**Inj**ector **L**ow impedance)*
  	- If you have low impedance injectors (``<6``&ohm;), there needs to be significant modifications made to use these. No covered in this howto documention, sorry you're on own!
  	
- **IGN**: *(**Ign**ition)*
  	- For coil per plug operation (COP/CNP), you need one of circuit per cylinder.
  	- For wasted spark set-up, you need one of these per two cylinders.
  	- If you require operation of a distributor, you only need one.
  	- For a fuel only system you do not require any of these circuits.
	- It does **NOT** drive coils directly, don't even try.
	- For driving of external ignitors, modifications are required.

- **RPM**: *(**R**evolutions **P**er **M**inute)*
  	- Most applications require 2 inputs for 2 sensors, and installing only 1 will limit the use of the unit significantly 2 is the default and recommended.
 
- **MAP**: *(**M**anifold **A**bsolute **P**ressure)* 
	- In the BOM boosted is the default / preferred sensor and provides sufficient accuracy for all naturally aspirated vehicles, and sufficent range to cover boosted applications up to 21psi. If you are planning boost levels in excess of or close to 21psi, from a relatively large turbo, there are other options that you need to investigate.

- **AAP**: *(**A**tmospheric **A**bsloute **P**ressure)* 
  	- Used for normalisation of the MAP vs atmospheric pressure, this is considered optional. Choose this if you live in a mountainous area, or intend to visit such areas using your vehicle, or if you live in New Zealand home of [**L``&``P**]. It's not needed for people who use their vehicles at one constant altitude (whatever that is).
- **MAF**: *(**M**ass **A**ir **F**low)* 
	- This is an alternative to the MAP sensor that is unsupported at this time, however the circuit is cheap and can be used as a general purpose analogue input also.

- **O2**: *(**O**xygen)*
  	- Only linear wide-band lambda sensors are supported at this time.

- **EGT**: *(**E**xhaust **G**as **T**emperature)* 
  	- Thermocouple driver IC, in Spin1 this circuitry is a crippled. 
	- It only supports up to 500Â°C temperatures as-it's currently configured.

#### Note: 
- PIP-3104 are listed for protected logic level FETs - DO NOT USE THEM, they are NOT robust. VNP10N07 (or 5, 20, etc Amp variants) are suitable replacements, there are many others.
- No electrolytic caps should be installed. In their place 10ÂµF TH tantalums can optionally be installed.

### BOM Configuration Overview

Configuring the BOM has been the tricky part. A spread sheet has been created that is tabbed with the various different sub circuits contained on the Puma PCB. The spread sheet can also be viewed as a [web  BOM]. Alternatively the BOM can be [downloaded](http://puma.freeems.org/preston.bom/PumaBom-WithMods-Element14.xlsx) as an Excel spreadsheet that can be opened also in OpenOffice.

*Git users download the [BOM here].*
