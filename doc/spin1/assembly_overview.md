## Assembling the board

IMPORTANT: If needed, modify the PCB as shown in “Spin 1 speciﬁc notes”

These steps should be performed sequentially

 - Install MCU, regulators, PLL and crystal circuits.
Follow the schematic to locate the component values, or install Kicad to be able to search in the schematic.
 - Test the MCU works by uploading the firmware.
 - Install rpm input circuit:choose hall input, or VR.
 - Install misc outputs like Fuel, ect.
 - Install injector circuits.
 - Install ignition circuits.
