# Assembling the board #

**The [schematics] are a 'guideline' only, and can be opened with any PDF viewer. All changes necessary are contained in the [BOM] and explained [here](#using_bom). Note, the schematics contain many, many, errors and the original design is not usable as is.**

Optionally the repos with all development files can be cloned. Click on [cloning Puma] for further details.

This is a 'hand assembly' process, and therefore the components will be placed from the centre of the PCB out toward the four edges, starting with the components that require the most amount of work to mount.
All through-hole components will be populated after the reflow process has been performed. 

#### Important: An anti-static surface must be present during assembly; an anti-static wrist strap should also be worn at all times.

For future reference if a component direction is not specified it is **non-polarised** and can be mounted in either direction.

The component placement directions will always be referenced in the following manner:

- PCB TOP side orientation: 
	- "**Spin 1**" and Puma eyes will always be in the lower right hand corner.

- PCB BOTTOM side orientation:
	- "**MAP**" and "**AAP**" are located on the left edge, with "**Puma**" and eyes mid to upper right side. 


**Follow these steps sequentially:**
