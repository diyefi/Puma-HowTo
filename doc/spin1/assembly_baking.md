## Some instructions about how to bake the board in your oven.

 - First things first: Ensure your oven won't be used for cooking food. It will end with high levels of lead.
 - You're going to use paste, so start with the passive components, and leave the MCU for the end. This ensures the paste will be (less viscous?) by the time you assemble the MCU.
