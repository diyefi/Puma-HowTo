## Ignition pullup mod
This mod 

/-- 337x260 img/placeholder_image.png "" **200 ohm 2W resistor**

- bend one leg of the restistor, so that it is parrellel and adjacent to other leg.
- place the resistor with the unbent leg in to the 12V (P4??) the bent leg should go in to IGN1 (P3??)

To make attaching future Ignition wire I have bent a loop into the leg that attaches to IGN1. This allows for a wire to be fed though and filled with solder resulting in sturdy easy connection.
 	
- Complete this process for each of the ignition channels IGN2, IGN 3, IGN4.
