# Introduction

This guide shows you how to choose the components, how to order the components, how to build your Spin 1 board and how to properly connect it to a vehicle.

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the main [FreeEMS.org site][FreeEMS] for general information, and the [Puma site][Puma] for more specific information.

This version of the manual includes instructions for the Spin 1 board, which is commonly provided as just a bare PCB. You will need to purchase parts based on [the BOM](#configuring_bom), and then install those parts. You will also need to program the board via the BDM programming port to get the initial boot loader installed. After the initial build, the board can be programmed with a USB connection to your computer. Supported platforms include Windows, Mac and Linux.
