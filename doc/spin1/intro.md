# Introduction

This guide shows you how to choose the components, how to order the components, how to build your Spin 1 board and how to properly connect it to a vehicle.

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the main [FreeEMS.org site][FreeEMS] for general information, and the [Puma site][Puma] for more specific information.

This version of the manual includes instructions for the Spin 1 board, which is commonly provided as just a bare PCB. You will need to purchase parts required for your build these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom), perform [PCB corrections](#PCB_modifications) then install those parts. You will also need to program the board via the BDM programming port to get a functional boot loader installed. After the initial build, the board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer. Supported platforms include Windows, Mac and Linux.
