# Introduction

#####Puma Spin 1 owners should be extremely grateful to Preston Saunders who has spent hundreds of hours creating this meticulously crafted documentation. Preston would like to thank Fred Cooke for his contribution to this howto, and putting up with the many hours of skpye calls. You have been **"O for awesome"** kiwi styles. But not as awesome as Preston himself.

This guide shows you how to choose the components, how to order the components, how to build your Spin 1 board and how to properly connect it to a vehicle.

It is assumed that you came to this guide from one of the main sites, if not, see the main [FreeEMS.org] site for general information, and the [Puma] site for more specific information.

This version of the manual includes instructions for the **Spin 1 board**, which was produced as a small one-off run of just 37 bare PCBs. You will need to purchase parts required for your build, these are listed in [the BOM](#using_bom), perform [PCB corrections](#assembly_essential_mods) then install those parts. You will also need to program the board via the BDM programming port to get a functional boot loader installed. After the initial build, the board can be programmed via a USB connection to your computer.
